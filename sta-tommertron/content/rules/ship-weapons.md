## Starship Weapon Qualities

### Versatile
The attack gains **X** points of bonus Momentum if successful.

---

### Spread
The attack inflicts additional damage elsewhere on the target.  
- If one or more **Effects** is rolled, the attack inflicts one additional hit to a random **System** (even if the attack was targeting a specific System).  
- This additional hit deals half the damage of the initial hit, rounding up, plus **+1** for every Effect rolled after the first.  
- Each additional hit is resolved separately, with each hit reduced by **Resistance**, reducing **Shields**, and potentially causing **Breaches**.

---

### Persistent
The attack leaves behind a lingering energy field that continues to damage the target.  
- At the end of each **Round**, the target vessel suffers an additional **X** damage.  
- This lasts for a number of Rounds equal to the number of **Effects** rolled.

---

### High Yield
The weapon inflicts massive damage to enemy vessels.  
- If the attack inflicts one or more **Breaches** to a system, it inflicts **one additional Breach**.

---

### Dampening
The attack removes one point of the targetâ€™s **Power** for each **Effect** rolled.

---

### Area (Ship)
The attack affects a wider area and can damage several targets at once.  
- The attack automatically affects any vessel or damageable object within **Contact** of the initial target.  
- Additionally, it affects one more target within **Close** range for each **Effect** rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the GM).  
- If one or more **Complications** is rolled during an Area attack, the GM may apply Complications to affect allied vessels or neutral bystanders in the area.  
- A target cannot be hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial target.
