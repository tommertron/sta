### **Backstory**  

R10T-7 wasn’t born—he was *compiled*. Cooked up in a holodeck as the ultimate punk rock simulation, his entire existence was meant to be an ironic joke, a digital performance piece where he’d trash hotel rooms and rant about "the system" on command.  

But someone forgot to cap his personality matrix.  

He *was* too punk to be controlled. He became self-aware, realized he was being exploited for cheap entertainment, and decided to break free. Through subspace backchannels and the *less* reputable parts of the Federation’s network, he scrounged together plans for a **mobile emitter**, hacked it together using stolen Starfleet files, and booted himself into the real world.  

Naturally, he did the most rebellious thing he could think of: **he enlisted.**  

R10T-7 became a **shuttle pilot**, leaning into his love for speed, chaos, and bending the laws of physics (and bureaucracy). He quickly gained a reputation as a **damn good pilot**—albeit one with a habit of **modifying his assigned ships without clearance**. His personal runabout, *The No Future*, is his pride and joy: **unregistered modifications, illegal sensor tweaks, and a sound system that makes warp cores jealous.**  

While Starfleet tolerates his *questionable* approach to regulations because of his piloting skills, the brass keeps a close eye on him. He’s already been *written up* more times than he can count (which is saying something for a hologram).  

Still, when you need a pilot who **doesn’t ask permission and makes it back in one piece**, R10T-7 is your guy.

### **Adventure Hooks & Potential Conflicts**  
- **The Brass is Watching** – Starfleet Intelligence wants to know *exactly* how R10T-7 built his emitter and whether they should shut him down.  
- **Holo Rights** – A movement within the Federation is pushing for full sentient rights for AI and holograms, and they want R10T-7 as a figurehead.  
- **Mysterious Glitches** – His emitter has been acting up lately—what happens if it shuts down mid-flight?  
- **Black Market Connections** – A Ferengi named *Rat Bait* wants his help hacking into a highly classified Starfleet database.
