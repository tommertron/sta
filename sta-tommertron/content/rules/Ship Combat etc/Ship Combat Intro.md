# Ship Combat Intro

- Each player takes a turn in the ship
- Each player needs to take a position
- If you're not in the right department, you can issue a command. But you only get that one dice roll. If you're there, you get to add your dice rolls for the assist
- Moving around the ship takes an action
- Doing most things in combat / a scene uses powers
- Damage and breaches (ugh)
- Review [[Momentum Spends (Ships)]]
