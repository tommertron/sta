## What is Momentum?

**Momentum** represents the positive outcomes of a character's actions, reflecting their ability to build on successes or gain an edge in the moment. In gameplay, it is a resource that players can generate by rolling more successes than required during a Task. Momentum can then be spent to improve results, create advantages, or gain additional information, allowing the crew to turn the tides in their favor during critical moments. It encourages teamwork and strategic play, embodying the spirit of resource

## Earning Momentum

- Whenever a character completes a Task with more successes than its Difficulty, the extra successes become Momentum.
- Each extra success equals one point of Momentum.
- You can choose to use Momentum immediately or save it for later.

## Managing Momentum:

- Your group can only have a maximum of 6 Momentum at a time.
- Each point of Momentum can be used independently.
At the end of a scene, reduce momentum pool by 1.

**Think of Momentum as fuel for your actions, allowing you to:**

- **Boost success:** Spend Momentum to add dice to your rolls, increasing your chance of success.
- **Reroll dice:** Gain another chance with some of your dice rolls.
- **Perform additional actions:** Take an extra Task during your turn.
- **Gain advantages:** Overcome challenges or enhance your actions temporarily.

Momentum Cost: The initial number (1 or 2) represents the basic Momentum cost to use the spend. It's the starting price, the ante to enter the game of tactical advantage.

The "I" stands for "Immediate." This indicates that the Momentum spend can be used right away, in the heat of the moment, as soon as the appropriate conditions are met. It's the swift response to an unfolding situation, the ability to react in the blink of an eye. When you see an "I," think of it as your character seizing the opportunity without delay.

The "R" stands for "Repeatable." This signifies that the Momentum spend can be used multiple times in succession, should you have enough Momentum to afford it. It's akin to a repeating phaser setting – you can keep firing as long as you have the power.
