## What is Threat

In *Star Trek Adventures*, **Threat** is a resource for the Gamemaster, representing mounting tension, risks, or opportunities for adversaries. It allows the Gamemaster to introduce challenges, escalate danger, or empower Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

## How Threat is Gained

The Gamemaster begins each session with **2 points of Threat per Player** in the group. Additional Threat is added in the following ways:

- **Complications**: When a character suffers a Complication during a Task, they or the Gamemaster may choose to add **2 points of Threat** instead of applying the Complication immediately.
- **Threatening Circumstances**: The Gamemaster may add **1–2 points of Threat** to the pool if the environment or narrative circumstances warrant it, such as during a high-stakes scene.
- **Non-Player Character Momentum**: NPCs cannot save unspent Momentum. Instead, any unused NPC Momentum is added directly to the Threat pool.

## How Threat is Spent

The Gamemaster can spend Threat to influence gameplay, create obstacles, or empower NPCs. Common uses include:

- **Non-Player Character Momentum**: NPCs may use Threat in the same ways that Player Characters use group Momentum.
- **Actions Equivalent to Generating Threat**: For any action that adds Threat (e.g., buying extra dice), an NPC must spend an equivalent number of Threat points instead.
- **Avoiding Complications**: If an NPC suffers a Complication, the Gamemaster may spend **2 Threat** to negate it.
- **Introducing Complications**: The Gamemaster can spend **2 Threat** to introduce a new Complication in the scene, altering the circumstances or increasing Difficulty.
- **Reinforcements**: Bring additional NPCs into the scene by spending Threat:
  - **1 Threat** per Minor NPC.
  - **2 Threat** per Notable NPC.
- **Environmental Effects**: Trigger environmental hazards or escalate the stakes by spending Threat.

## Example
During a tense confrontation, the Gamemaster spends **3 Threat** to add reinforcements—two Minor Klingon Warriors—to the scene. Later, a Player Character rolls a Complication while trying to disable a warp core. The Gamemaster adds **2 Threat** instead of applying an immediate negative effect.

Threat is a dynamic tool, keeping the story unpredictable and engaging by balancing player actions with meaningful consequences.
