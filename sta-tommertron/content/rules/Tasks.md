## What are Tasks?

In *Star Trek Adventures*, **Tasks** represent actions characters take when the outcome is uncertain or failure could drive the story forward. Here's how Tasks work:

## Steps to Perform a Task

1. **Gamemaster Sets Up:**
   - Chooses the most relevant **Attribute** and **Discipline** for the Task.
   - Identifies any applicable Focuses the character might have.
   - Sets the **Difficulty** of the Task, typically ranging from 0 (simple) to 5 or higher (complex).

2. **Roll the Dice:**
   - Start with **2d20** as your basic dice pool.
   - Add extra dice (up to a maximum of 5 total) by:
     - Spending Momentum.
     - Adding Threat to the GM's pool.
     - Using Determination (one die treated as an automatic success).
   - Roll the dice pool.

3. **Count Successes:**
   - Each die roll ≤ **Target Number** (Attribute + Discipline) counts as **1 success**.
   - If a [Focus](./basics/#focuses) applies, each die roll ≤ **Discipline** scores **2 successes**.
   - Rolling a natural **1** scores **2 successes**.
   - Rolling a natural **20** creates a **Complication** (explained later).

4. **Determine Task Result:**
   - If the number of successes **≥ Difficulty**, the Task succeeds!
   - If the number of successes is **< Difficulty**, the Task fails.
   - Any additional successes beyond the Difficulty generate **Momentum**.

5. **Outcome and Momentum:**
   - The Gamemaster describes the outcome of the Task.
   - Players can spend generated [Momentum](./Momentum.md) to:
     - Enhance success.
     - Create an advantage.
     - Gain valuable information.
   - Any Complications rolled are applied by the Gamemaster, adding twists or challenges.

## Example
Commander S'Ren is attempting to bypass a Klingon security system. The GM assigns a **Reason (10)** and **Engineering (4)** combination, giving a Target Number of 14. S'Ren rolls **2d20**, scoring a 12 and a 3. Both dice are successes, and the Task’s Difficulty of 2 is met. The GM describes how S'Ren successfully hacks the system and gains a point of **Momentum** for future use.

Tasks are the backbone of *Star Trek Adventures*, driving the narrative forward through collaborative problem-solving and thrilling dice rolls.
