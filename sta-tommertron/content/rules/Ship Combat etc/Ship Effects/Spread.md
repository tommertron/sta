The attack inflicts additional damage elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the attack inflicts one additional hit to a random System (even if the attack was targeting a specific System), which deals half the damage of the initial hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes Breaches, individually.
