# Ship Combat - NPCs

The normal rules for starship combat have been streamlined for NPC starships. An NPC ship does not have specific crew at individual positions on the bridge, instead, each NPC vessel has a Crew Quality, which provides ratings which serve as the Attribute and Discipline scores needed by the vessel for any given Task. NPC crew used in this way are always considered to have an applicable Focus.

| **CREW QUALITY** | **ATTRIBUTE** | **DISCIPLINE** |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Basic            | 8             | 1              |
| Proficient       | 9             | 2              |
| Talented         | 10            | 3              |
| Exceptional      | 11            | 4              |

Because individual NPC crew are not being tracked, each NPC ship takes a number of Turns during each Round equal to its scale, representing the individual actions of that ship’s crew. However, each Task attempted after the first during each Round from any single role increases in Difficulty by 1.

## NPC Damage

While NPC vessels can make use of the full damage rules, this can become burdensome in larger battles where there are many ships involved. Instead of tracking individual System Breaches, use the following:

- **Impact**: Whenever the ship suffers one or more Breaches, it loses a single Turn during the next Round. This is not cumulative. It also loses 2 Power.
- **Damaged**: If the total number of Breaches the NPC ship has suffered is equal to or greater than half the Scale of the ship, then the ship has been significantly Damaged. This increases the Difficulty of all Tasks attempted by the ship by 2 until repaired. The Difficulty to repair this is 3.
- **Disabled**: If the total number of Breaches the NPC ship has suffered is equal to the Scale of the ship, then the ship has been disabled. The ship is no longer fully-operational and cannot take any further Turns during this scene.
- **Destroyed**: If the total number of Breaches the NPC ship has suffered exceeds the ship’s Scale, then the ship has been destroyed utterly. The ship explodes in a burst of flame and a shower of scrap metal, though this explosion is not large enough to cause damage to other ships.
