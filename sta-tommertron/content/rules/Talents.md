## What are Talents?

Talents in "Star Trek Adventures" represent unique abilities or advantages that set characters apart, reflecting their specialized training, personal experiences, and innate abilities. Here’s a detailed look at how talents function:

## General Overview

### Definition

Talents give characters specific advantages or abilities in particular situations, such as extra dice, re-rolls, or special actions that align with their expertise and background.

### Requirements

Some talents have prerequisites, such as belonging to a specific species or having a certain level in a discipline. These requirements must be met to select the talent.

### Structure

Each talent consists of a condition under which it can be used and a benefit provided when that condition is met.

## Example Talents and Their Effects

### Cautious

- **Requirement**: None  
- **Effect**: Choose a discipline. When attempting a task with that discipline and buying one or more d20s by spending Momentum, you may re-roll a single d20.

### Collaboration

- **Requirement**: None  
- **Effect**: Choose a discipline. When an ally attempts a task using that discipline, you may spend one Momentum (Immediate) to allow them to use your score for that discipline and one of your focuses.

- **Effect**: When spending one or more Momentum to Obtain Information, ask one additional question.

### Technical Expertise

## Special Talents for Specific Roles

### Command Talents

#### Advisor

- **Effect**: When using the Swift Task Momentum spend, do not increase the difficulty of the second task if one of the tasks is to pilot a vessel or vehicle.

#### Precise Evasion

- **Effect**: When succeeding at the Evasive Action task, spend two Momentum to ensure the ship does not suffer the increased difficulty for attacks normally caused by Evasive Action.

### Security Talents

#### Interrogation

### Science Talents

#### Computer Expertise

#### Testing a Theory
