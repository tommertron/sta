## Talents

- **Psychokinesis:** You can manipulate and control objects with your mind. You may exert a physical force up to Medium range by spending Momentum to affect objects or apply a Control + Security Task.

- **Disarming Nature:** Caitians excel at putting others at ease. In a Social Conflict, reduce the Difficulty of Tests to make your target relax or trust you by 1.  

- **Untapped Potential:** As an inexperienced but talented officer, your Attributes cannot exceed 11 or Disciplines 4 while you have this Talent. When you succeed at a Task, roll 1d6:
