## Combat Overview

During combat, characters take turns performing one **Combat Task** and multiple **Combat Minor Actions**. 

- **Minor Actions**: Each character gets one free Minor Action per Turn. Additional Minor Actions cost Momentum (Immediate) equal to the number of previous Minor Actions taken that Turn. Each Minor Action can only be performed once per Turn.
- **Remember**: Add the character’s **Security** Discipline to the weapon’s damage rating when calculating attack damage.

## Order of Play

1. **Choose your Minor Action**
	- Most phasers have a "Charge" that you must select to choose the Effect you will try for
	-  See [List of Comabt Minor Actions](./combat/#combat-minor-actions)

1. **Choose Weapon and Target**: 
   - Declare the attack and select a target.
   - Specify whether the attack is **lethal** or **non-lethal**:
     - Lethal attacks add **1 Threat** to the pool.
   
2. **Make the Attack Task**: Depending on the type of attack:
   - Melee Attacks: Use **Daring + Security** to resolve the Task.
   - Ranged Attacks: Use **Control + Security** to resolve the Task.

3. **Determine Success**: If the attack Task succeeds:
   - Roll **Damage Dice** equal to the weapon or hazard’s damage rating.
   - Apply Resistance (if any) to reduce damage.

4. **Apply Damage to Stress**:
   - Subtract the final damage result from the target’s Stress.
   - Track conditions for injuries (see [Injuries](./combat/#injuries)).

## Melee Attacks

- Attribute + Discipline: **Daring + Security**.
- Range: Must be in close range with the target.
- Weapon: Includes unarmed strikes, blades, and other melee tools.
- Resistance: Target applies any Resistance to reduce the damage dealt.

---

## Ranged Attacks

- Attribute + Discipline: **Control + Security**.
- Range: Can vary by weapon type; ensure target is within effective range.
- Weapon: Includes phasers, disruptors, and projectile weapons.
- Resistance: Target applies any Resistance to reduce the damage dealt.

## Injuries

A creature suffers an Injury under the following conditions:
- Takes **5+ damage** from a single attack.
- Stress is reduced to **0** due to an attack.
- Takes damage when already at **0 Stress**.

### Preventing Injuries
- **Player Characters**: May avoid an Injury by spending **Determination** or adding **2 Threat** to the pool.
- **Non-Player Characters**: Major NPCs can spend **2 Threat** to avoid an Injury.

## Combat Tasks

- **Assist:** Nominate a single ally you can communicate with, and assist their next Task.
- **Attack**: Target an enemy or viable target.
- **Create Advantage**: Generate a beneficial circumstance or remove a Complication.
- **Direct**: (Commanding officers only) Nominate another character to attempt a single Task, assisted by you. That person gets an assist. ::can only be used once per scene::
- **Guard**: Find a defensible position, focus on surroundings, or gain additional attack readiness.
- **Pass**: Decline to attempt a Task.
- **Ready**: Wait for a specific situation or event before attempting a Task.
- **Recover**: Get behind cover, attempt a Fitness + Command Task (Difficulty 2). Gain 1 Resistance per Effect rolled on Cover Dice, regain the ability to Avoid an Injury, and regain 2 Stress per Momentum spent.
- **Sprint**: Attempt to move further and faster (Fitness + Security Task, Difficulty 0).Success grants 1 zone of movement, +1 zone per Momentum spent (Repeatable).
- **First Aid:** Treat the injury of a character within Reach.
- **Other Tasks**: Perform other actions at the Gamemaster's discretion.

## Combat Minor Actions

- **Aim**: the character may re-roll a single d20 made on an attack during this Turn.
- **Draw Item**: the character may pick up an item within Reach, draw a weapon or pull out another item carried on their person or stowed in their gear.
- **Drop Prone**: the character immediately drops to the ground, making them a smaller target. A character may not Drop Prone and Stand in the same Turn.
- Interact: the character interacts with an object in the environment. Complex interactions may require a Task instead.
- **Movement**: the character moves to any point within Medium range. This Minor Action cannot be carried out if the character performs any movement-related Tasks.
- **Prepare**: the character prepares for, or spends time setting up, a Task. Some Tasks require a Minor Action to be taken before the Task can be attempted, or the Minor Action gives a bonus.
- **Stand**: if the character is prone they may use a Minor Action to stand, removing all the benefits and disadvantages of being prone. A character may not Stand and Drop Prone in the same Turn.

Momentum Cost: The initial number (1 or 2) represents the basic Momentum cost to use the spend. It's the starting price, the ante to enter the game of tactical advantage.

The "I" stands for "Immediate." This indicates that the Momentum spend can be used right away, in the heat of the moment, as soon as the appropriate conditions are met. It's the swift response to an unfolding situation, the ability to react in the blink of an eye. When you see an "I," think of it as your character seizing the opportunity without delay.

The "R" stands for "Repeatable." This signifies that the Momentum spend can be used multiple times in succession, should you have enough Momentum to afford it. It's akin to a repeating phaser setting – you can keep firing as long as you have the power.
