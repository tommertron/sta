## 🌌 Ship Features

- **⚡ Hot-Rod Impulse Drive** – Runs *way* faster than regulation allows, but the energy drain is dodgy.  
- **🔧 Overclocked Warp Core** – Warp 5 *technically*, but sometimes hits Warp 5.3 (*briefly, before things catch fire*).  
- **📡 Subspace Signal Booster** – Unofficially taps into Starfleet encrypted channels… but don’t ask how.  
- **🎸 Integrated Sound System** – Can blast punk rock at full volume through the external comms.  
- **💾 Illegal Memory Buffer** – Allows fast system resets but risks total shutdown if overused.  
- **⚠️ Autopilot Disabled (On Purpose)** – “If you ain’t flyin’ it yerself, what’s the point?” – R10T-7

### **🚀 Backstory: How This Ship *Shouldn’t Exist***
*Nebula’s Bollocks* started life as a standard **Danube-class runabout**, just another Starfleet utility shuttle. But then **R10T-7** got his hands on it.  

Through a combination of **unauthorized modifications, black-market parts, and sheer disregard for regulations**, he **transformed it into the fastest, loudest, most unpredictable** vessel in Starfleet.  

It’s **technically still listed as an active shuttle**, but Fleet Command keeps **"losing track"** of it due to its **modified transponder** (*which randomly spoofs itself as different ships to avoid detection*). The **autopilot is disabled** on purpose, because *"Real pilots don’t need a bloody autopilot."*  

Despite its *questionable legality*, *Nebula’s Bollocks* has saved more than a few lives—just as long as its **warp core doesn’t explode first**.

## 🔥 Adventure Hooks

- **Starfleet Command Wants It Back** – Some Admiral finally noticed that this shuttle is **way** outside specs and wants it impounded.  
- **The Ferengi Want Their Parts** – R10T-7 may have “borrowed” some high-end tech from the wrong people.  
- **Surprise System Crash** – The **Illegal Memory Buffer** fails mid-flight. Time to fix the ship *while flying at max speed*.  
- **Someone’s Hacked the Signal Booster** – R10T-7’s hacked **subspace booster** has attracted some… *unwanted* transmissions.
