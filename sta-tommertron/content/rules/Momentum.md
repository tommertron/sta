# Momentum

At the end of a scene, reduce momentum pool by 1.

The Player group may only ever have a pool of 6 Momentum at any one time

**Earning Momentum:**

- Whenever a character completes a Task with more successes than its Difficulty, the extra successes become Momentum.
- Each extra success equals one point of Momentum.
- You can choose to use Momentum immediately or save it for later.

**Managing Momentum:**

- Your group can only have a maximum of 6 Momentum at a time.
- Each point of Momentum can be used independently.

**Think of Momentum as fuel for your actions, allowing you to:**

- **Boost success:** Spend Momentum to add dice to your rolls,Â increasing your chance of success.
- **Reroll dice:** Gain another chance with some of your dice rolls.
- **Perform additional actions:** Take an extra Task during your turn.
- **Gain advantages:** Overcome challenges or enhance your actions temporarily.
