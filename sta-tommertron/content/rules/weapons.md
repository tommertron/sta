## Weapon Qualities

### Accurate
If Aimed, the creature may re-roll any number of d20s.

### Area
Attack affects every creature or object within **Reach** of the target, plus one additional target within **Close** for each Effect rolled. Allies may be hit for a **Complication**.

### Charge
If Prepared, the creature may add either [Area](#area), Intense, Piercing 2, or Vicious 1 to the attack.

### Cumbersome
The weapon must be **Prepared** each turn to use.

### Deadly
Increase **Difficulty** by 1 to make a **Non-lethal** attack.

### Debilitating
First Aid on creatures injured by this weapon increases **Difficulty** by 1.

### Grenade
Cannot attack at **Long** or **Extreme** range. May be used 3 times per **Scene**.

### Hidden
The weapon may be hidden as a **Minor Action**. Searches require an **INS + SEC** or **REA + SEC** Test with a **Difficulty** of X to locate the weapon.

### Inaccurate
The weapon gains no benefit from **Aim**.

### Intense

### Knockdown
If one or more Effects are rolled on this attack, then the target is knocked prone. The target may resist this effect by adding a number of points to **Threat** equal to the number of Effects rolled. For Non-Player Characters, the Gamemaster spends points from Threat instead of adding to Threat.
