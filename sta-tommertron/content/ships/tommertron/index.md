## Talents

The **USS Tommertron** is equipped with the following starship talents:

- **Improved Hull Integrity:** The ship’s Resistance increases by 1.  
- **Improved Power Systems:** When succeeding at a Power Management Task, the ship gains 2 Power per Momentum spent (Repeatable) instead of 1.  
- **Improved Warp Drive:** When spending Power to go to warp, roll 1 for each Power spent. For each Effect rolled, regain that point of Power.  
- **Modular Laboratories:** At the start of a mission, choose how the laboratories are configured; this counts as an Advantage that applies to work performed within the laboratories.  
- **Saucer Separation:** The ship is designed so the saucer section can separate from the drive section, operating as two distinct Scale 5 ships.  
- **Redundant Systems (Structure):** When the ship’s Structure becomes Damaged or Disabled, the crew may activate redundant systems as a Minor Action.  
  - If Damaged: It is no longer Damaged.  
  - If Disabled: It becomes Damaged instead.  
  - This can only be activated once per mission.
