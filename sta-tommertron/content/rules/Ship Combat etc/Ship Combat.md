# Ship Combat

## Quick Reminders

- Remember that each ship doesn't take a turn, each player on the ship takes a turn.
- For NPC ships, they get to take a turn per scale of the ship.
- For NPC ships, the crew gets an assist roll
- If damage of 5 or more, there is a breach (roll to see on table what system)
- Systems can be restored from the bridge, but must move to that section to repair them if damaged

# Movement and terrain

Moving the ship in starship combat is the responsibility of a vessel’s helmsman, and typically requires a **Task**, though these Tasks have a Difficulty of 0 under normal circumstances, and therefore do not require Players to roll any dice. Any Traits affecting the space environment may increase this Difficulty.

## Combat Tasks and Minor Actions

Each bridge station has its own set of combat Tasks, unique to the character’s role. In their Turn, each Player can take one [[Ship Actions - Minor]] and attempt one Task (before Momentum and Determination spends.)

# Making an Attack

Attacks using a starship’s weapons follow the same rules as personal combat, as follows:

1. The attacker chooses a weapon system the ship is equipped with — there are two types: energy weapons, and torpedoes.
2. The attacker then nominates a viable target for that weapon: a single vessel or another viable target visible
3. The attacker attempts a **Control + Security Task**, assisted by the ship’s **Weapons + Security**, with a Difficulty determined by the weapon used.
   - For an energy weapon, the Difficulty is 2.
   - For torpedoes, the Difficulty is 3.
   - If a specific System has been targeted, increase the Difficulty by 1.
   - If the target is not at the weapon’s optimal range, increase the Difficulty by 1 for each range band outside the optimal range.
4. If the Task is successful, then the attack inflicts X **Damage**, as described in its weapon profile. If a specific system was not targeted, roll to determine which system was hit on the table below

## Damage and Repairs

Whenever any ship suffers damage, follow this procedure:

1. Roll the number of dice for the attack or hazard’s damage rating. The total rolled is the amount of damage the attack or hazard inflicts.
2. If the target has any Resistance Dice (from Cover, etc.), roll those, and add the total rolled to any static Resistance the ship has. This total is the ship’s total Resistance against the attack.
3. Reduce the total damage by the total Resistance. If there is any damage remaining after this reduction, the ship loses one point of Shields for each point of remaining damage. The ship may also suffer one or more Breaches to the system struck, if any of the following conditions occur:
   - If the ship suffers five or more damage from a single attack or hazard, after reduction from Resistance, the system hit suffers a Breach.
   - If the ship is reduced to 0 Shields by that attack or hazard, it suffers a Breach.
   - If the ship had 0 Shields before the attack or hazard, and the attack or hazard inflicts one or more damage, the ship suffers a Breach.
