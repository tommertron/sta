## Power

At the start of each scene, the ship generates its full capacity of Power, **equal to its Engines value** and any Power which remained unused at the end of the previous scene is lost.

This provides characters with a pool of points to draw from when attempting actions with the ship that have a **Power requirement.**

If the ship would lose more power than it has remaining — enough to reduce the ship’s current Power to less than 0 — then the ship suffers a Complication to a randomly-determined system. This Complication relates to the loss of vital power to some aspect of the ship’s operation.

See [[Ship Power]] for more info.

# Crew Support

The total amount of Crew Support available is **equal to the** **ship’s Scale**. Spending Crew Support brings members of the wider crew to the forefront, putting focus on them and making them an active and significant part of the mission.

Crew Support is a finite pool of points, and do not replenish until the start of the next mission.

# Resistance

Starships have a Resistance value, which reduces incoming damage suffered by a ship in the same way as it does to a character. **A ship’s base Resistance is equal to its Scale**.

# Shields

Starships and starbases are commonly equipped with powerful layers of deflector shields. A starship has a **Shields** rating, and this is reduced when the ship is subjected to damage, and which can be replenished through the actions of the crew and with time. A ship has Shields equal to its **Structure + Security**.
