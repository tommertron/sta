Player Characters begin each session with a single point of Determination, and no character can have more than three points of Determination at any time. Using and gaining Determination is tied to a character’s [[Values]], and to the Directives in play during a mission.

Whenever a character is attempting a Task for which one of their Values would be advantageous, they may spend one point of Determination

## How to Use Determination

When a character’s **Value** or the mission’s **Directive** would be advantageous in a situation, the PC may spend **Determination** to:

| **Opportunity**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perfect Opportunity**   | Gain a bonus d20 that has rolled a 1 (2 successes).                             |
| **Moment of Inspiration** | Re-roll all the dice in the dice pool.                                          |
| **Surge of Activity**     | Immediately perform another **Task** as soon as this one is resolved.           |
| **Make it So**            | Immediately create an [[Advantage]] that applies to the current scene.          |

## Getting Determination Points To Go Against a Value

If the character is in a situation where one of their Values would make the situation more complicated or more difficult, the Gamemaster may offer the Player one Determination in exchange for suffering a Complication: this may take the form of a course of action, or a decision not to act, but any kind of Complication is suitable so long as it fits the circumstances. The Player can choose not to accept this offer — and Players can choose to suggest situations where their character might face this Complication — but if they accept the Complication, then the setback occurs, without any ability to avoid it.

## Example

> The Enterprise has rescued an injured Romulan after responding to a distress call in the Neutral Zone. Dr. Crusher is attempting to save the Romulan’s life, but the Romulan needs a blood transfusion. Worf is the only member of the crew with the correct cellular factors to help. However, Worf despises Romulans, and this is part of his “Proud and Honorable Klingon” Value; the Gamemaster offers Worf a point of Determination and asks that Worf refuse to help the Romulan. Worf accepts, and the Romulan dies in sickbay.

## Challenging a Value to Grow

Once during a mission, if a character has a Value which could affect a Task or situation negatively, they may challenge that Value. The character immediately gains a point of Determination, and then crosses out the challenged Value, meaning that it cannot be used again for the remainder of the mission.

If a **Directive** is challenged, it is not crossed out, but the PC may suffer disciplinary action.
