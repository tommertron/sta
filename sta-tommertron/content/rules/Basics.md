## Advantage

A positive circumstance or condition that benefits a character during gameplay. It can help them succeed in tasks, overcome challenges, or achieve their objectives more easily. Players can gain advantages through their actions, decisions, or by using resources within the game.

## Assistance

One or more characters may assist the **Task**. Each character attempting to assist rolls 1d20, using a Target Number of their own **Attribute** + **Discipline** combination. Any successes they score are added to the Task’s success, providing the main character attempting the Task scores 1 success.

## Consequence

A negative outcome or penalty that occurs as a result of a player's actions or decisions. This can range from damage to the player's character or ship, to negative consequences in the storyline or mission they are engaged in. Consequences can challenge players to think strategically and creatively in order to overcome obstacles and continue progressing in the game.

## Determination

Player Characters begin each session with a single point of Determination, and no character can have more than three points of Determination at any time. Using and gaining Determination is tied to a character’s Values, and to the Directives in play during a mission.

Whenever a character is attempting a Task for which one of their Values would be advantageous, they may spend one point of Determination. For more information see the deep dive on [Determination](./Determination.md)

## Directive

A specific goal or objective given to the players by their commanding officer or the mission they are on. Directives can range from exploring new planets to engaging in diplomatic negotiations or engaging in combat with hostile forces. Players must work together to achieve their directives and advance the storyline of the game.

## Focuses

Different specializations that player characters have. If there is an applicable Focus, then each die that rolls a success scores two successes.
