Momentum Cost: The initial number (1 or 2) represents the basic Momentum cost to use the spend. It's the starting price, the ante to enter the game of tactical advantage.

The "I" stands for "Immediate." This indicates that the Momentum spend can be used right away, in the heat of the moment, as soon as the appropriate conditions are met. It's the swift response to an unfolding situation, the ability to react in the blink of an eye. When you see an "I," think of it as your character seizing the opportunity without delay.

The "R" stands for "Repeatable." This signifies that the Momentum spend can be used multiple times in succession, should you have enough Momentum to afford it. It's akin to a repeating phaser setting – you can keep firing as long as you have the power.
