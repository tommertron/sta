## Challenges Overview

Challenges are sequences of events or situations requiring multiple Tasks to resolve. They provide a flexible framework for presenting diverse problems and emphasize teamwork and strategy.

---

## Types of Challenges

### Basic Challenge
A straightforward Challenge consisting of **Key Tasks**, which must be completed to succeed. The Tasks may be independent or interrelated, depending on the narrative.

- **Key Tasks**: The primary Tasks required to overcome the Challenge.  
- **Optional Tasks**: Characters may perform additional Tasks to:  
  - Remove Complications.  
  - Generate Momentum.  
  - Reduce the Difficulty of a Key Task (by 1, or more with GM approval).

---

### Structuring Basic Challenges

Challenges can be structured in several ways, depending on the scenario:

#### Linear Challenges
- Key Tasks must be completed in a specific order.
- Simple to implement but less flexible.

#### Gated Challenges
- Some Key Tasks are locked and require others to be completed first.
- Allows for more narrative flexibility.
- Example: Reaching main engineering before shutting down the warp core.

#### Group Challenges
- Collective effort involving multiple characters.
- Restrictions:
  - A character cannot assist multiple Tasks during the Challenge.
  - Tasks attempted after assisting or attempting others have an increased **Difficulty** (+1 per additional Task).

---

### Timed Challenges

Timed Challenges add urgency to the scenario by introducing a time limit.

- **Intervals**: GM defines a set number of intervals to complete the Challenge.  
  - Suggested intervals: 2–3 times the number of Key Tasks.  
  - Each interval represents a specific time period (e.g., 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day).  
- **Momentum Spend**: Reduce the time taken for a Task from 2 intervals to 1 by spending 1 Momentum.  
- **Complications**: Add extra intervals to the Task.  

Failure to complete the Challenge within the intervals should result in severe consequences.

## Opposition in Challenges

Challenges may involve opposition, adding tension and complexity.

| **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Disruption**      | Opposition disrupts or interferes, increasing Task Difficulty by 1–2 or expanding the Complication range. |
| **Direct Opposition** | Turns Tasks into Opposed Tasks, potentially adding hazards or consequences on failure.                |
| **Contest**         | Both sides aim to achieve the same objective. They alternate Tasks, with the winner completing the Challenge first. |
| **Conflict**        | Each side pursues mutually exclusive goals, often in combat or social situations. Progress follows Rounds and Turns. |

## Momentum Spends for Challenges

| **Name**            | **Cost** | **Description**                                                         |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generate Momentum** | Varies   | Perform Tasks to gain additional Momentum for the group.               |
| **Reduce Difficulty** | 1+       | Spend Momentum to lower the Difficulty of a Key Task.                  |
| **Speed Task**        | 1        | Reduce the time taken for a Task in a Timed Challenge by one interval. |

## Example: Reaching Engineering to Prevent Warp Core Breach

The crew must reach engineering and shut down the warp core. The GM sets the Challenge as follows:

- **Key Tasks**:  
  1. Navigate hazardous corridors.  
  2. Disable force fields blocking access.  
  3. Shut down the warp core.  

- **Structure**:  
  - Gated Challenge: Task 1 unlocks Task 2, which then unlocks Task 3.  

- **Timed Challenge**:  
  - Intervals: 6 intervals, each representing 10 minutes.  
  - Momentum Spend: Reduce a Task from 2 intervals to 1 with 1 Momentum.  

- **Opposition**:  
  - Klingon saboteurs introduce **Direct Opposition**, turning Tasks into Opposed Tasks.

## Notes on Challenges

1. **Creativity**: Encourage players to approach the Challenge creatively.  
2. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Use Traits, tools, or narrative circumstances to modify Difficulty dynamically.  
3. **Consequences of Failure**: Failing a Challenge should have meaningful consequences, such as additional Complications or partial success with drawbacks.

## Key Terms

#### Key Task
A critical Task that must be completed to overcome the Challenge.

#### Momentum Spend
Momentum used during the Challenge to gain specific benefits, such as reducing time or Difficulty.

#### Opposition
Adversaries or obstacles that add tension to the Challenge, increasing Difficulty or introducing Opposed Tasks.
