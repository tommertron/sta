## What are Talents?

Talents in "Star Trek Adventures" represent unique abilities or advantages that set characters apart, reflecting their specialized training, personal experiences, and innate abilities. Here’s a detailed look at how talents function:

## General Overview

1. **Definition**:
   - Talents give characters specific advantages or abilities in particular situations, such as extra dice, re-rolls, or special actions that align with their expertise and background.
2. **Requirements**:
   - Some talents have prerequisites, such as belonging to a specific species or having a certain level in a discipline. These requirements must be met to select the talent.
3. **Structure**:
   - Each talent consists of a condition under which it can be used and a benefit provided when that condition is met.
