# Threat

The Gamemaster begins each session with 2 points of Threat for every Player in the group.

They gain Threat in the following circumstances:

**Complications**: when a character suffers one or more Complications on a Task they or the Gamemaster may choose not to have the Complication take effect, but this is in exchange for adding two points to the Threat pool.

**Threatening Circumstances**: the environment or circumstances of a new scene may be threatening enough to warrant adding one or two points of Threat to the pool.

**Non-Player Character Momentum**: Non-Player Characters with unspent Momentum cannot save it like Player Characters because they do not have a group Momentum pool. Instead, a Non-Player Character adds unspent Momentum to the Threat pool.

In return, the Gamemaster can spend Threat in a few ways. Examples of these can be found in the mission that accompanies these rules:

- **Non-Player Character Momentum**: Non-Player Characters may use Threat in all the ways that Player Characters use group Momentum.
- **Non-Player Character Threat Spends**: for any action that would add one or more points to Threat, a Non- Player Character performing the same action or choice must spend an equivalent number of points of Threat.
- **Non-Player Character Complications**: if a Non-Player Character suffers a Complication, the Gamemaster may prevent the Complication by spending two Threat.
- **Complication**: the Gamemaster may create a Complication by spending two Threat.
- **Reinforcements**: the Gamemaster may bring in additional Non-Player Characters during a scene. Minor NPCs cost one Threat apiece, while Notable NPCs cost two.
- **Environmental Effects**: the Gamemaster may trigger or cause problems within the environment by spending Threat.
