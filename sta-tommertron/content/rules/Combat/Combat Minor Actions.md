# Combat Minor Actions

- **Aim**: the character may re-roll a single d20 made on an attack during this Turn.
- **Draw Item**: the character may pick up an item within Reach, draw a weapon or pull out another item carried on their person or stowed in their gear.
- **Drop Prone**: the character immediately drops to the ground, making them a smaller target. A character may not Drop Prone and Stand in the same Turn.
- Interact: the character interacts with an object in the environment. Complex interactions may require a Task instead.
- **Movement**: the character moves to any point within Medium range. This Minor Action cannot be carried out if the character performs any movement-related Tasks.
- **Prepare**: the character prepares for, or spends time setting up, a Task. Some Tasks require a Minor Action to be taken before the Task can be attempted, or the Minor Action gives a bonus.
- **Stand**: if the character is prone they may use a Minor Action to stand, removing all the benefits and disadvantages of being prone. A character may not Stand and Drop Prone in the same Turn.
