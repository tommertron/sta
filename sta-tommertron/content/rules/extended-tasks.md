## Extended Tasks Overview

Extended Tasks represent challenges that cannot be resolved in a single attempt. They are best used in situations where additional pressure, such as combat or a time constraint, increases tension. Extended Tasks simulate activities requiring an uncertain amount of time and effort, especially in perilous situations.

Additional details can be found on p. 282 of the rulebook.

## Key Components

### Work
- Represents the amount of effort required to complete the Extended Task.
- Tracked on a **Work Track**, typically ranging from **5 to 20**.
- Success in a Task adds **Work** to the track.

### Magnitude
- Represents the complexity of the Extended Task.
- Typically ranges from **1 to 5**.
- The Extended Task is completed when the number of **Breakthroughs** equals the Magnitude.

### Resistance
- Some Extended Tasks have **Resistance**, which reduces the amount of Work added to the track after each Task.
- Resistance typically ranges from **0 to 3**.

### Base Difficulty
- The base Difficulty of all Tasks for the Extended Task.
- Derived from environmental factors, character abilities, and the nature of the challenge.
- May be modified by Traits or Breakthroughs.

## Steps to Complete an Extended Task

1. **Perform a Task:** The player rolls **d20s** for the Extended Task using:
   - The **attribute** and **discipline** relevant to the challenge.
   - The Difficulty of the Task, determined by the GM.
   - Focuses and Talents may be applied as normal.
   - Success generates Momentum, which can be spent on additional benefits (see Momentum Spends below).

2. **Roll for Work:** If the Task is successful:
   - Roll **2 Challenge Dice (CD)** plus a number of dice equal to the character’s **discipline** used for the Task.
   - The result is the amount of **Work** done, factoring in Challenge Dice results.

3. **Apply Resistance:** Subtract the Extended Task’s **Resistance** (if any) from the Work.

4. **Mark Work and Check Breakthroughs:**  
   - Apply the remaining Work to the **Work Track**.  
   - If the following conditions are met, a **Breakthrough** is achieved:  
     - **5+ Work** is completed in a single Task after Resistance.  
     - The **Work Track** is filled or overfilled.  

5. **Complete the Extended Task:**  
   - The Extended Task is completed when the number of **Breakthroughs** equals its **Magnitude**.  
   - Each Breakthrough reduces the **Base Difficulty** of future Tasks by **1** (minimum of 0).  
   - If the Base Difficulty is already **0**, further Breakthroughs add **+1 Work** to future rolls.

## Momentum Spends for Extended Tasks

| **Name**            | **Cost** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-———————|-———|———————————————————————————|
| **Additional Work**  | 1        | Add +1 to the Work done for this Task before Resistance is applied.              |
| **Piercing**         | 1        | Ignore up to 2 points of Resistance for this Task.                               |
| **Re-Roll Work**     | 1        | Re-roll any number of Challenge Dice for the current Task.                       |

## Effects in Extended Tasks

Challenge Dice in Extended Tasks normally do not trigger additional effects, unless specific benefits apply. Below are examples of effects that may occur:

#### Triumphant
- When a Breakthrough is achieved, and at least one Effect is rolled, gain an **additional Breakthrough**.

#### Scrutinize X
- Ignore X points of Resistance for each Effect rolled.

#### Progression X
- Add X additional Work for each Effect rolled.

These effects may be triggered by tools, advantages, or character Talents.

## Complications in Extended Tasks

Complications represent setbacks during Extended Tasks. They can be used in the following ways:

#### Dead End
- Remove **4 Work** from the Work Track after resolving the Task.

#### Unforeseen Problem
- Increase the Extended Task’s Resistance by **+2**, up to a maximum of **4**.

## Example: Defusing a Cloaked Mine

The crew of the Enterprise faces a perilous situation as a cloaked mine attaches itself to the ship’s hull. The Gamemaster assigns the following parameters to this Extended Task:

- **Work:** 12  
- **Magnitude:** 3  
- **Resistance:** 1  
- **Base Difficulty:** 3  

### First Attempt
Lieutenant Reed uses **Control 10 + Security 4** with his Focus in Explosives. He rolls 4 successes, overcoming the Difficulty. Rolling 6 Challenge Dice (2 base + 4 Security), Reed scores **5 Work** after subtracting Resistance, achieving a Breakthrough.

### Second Attempt
A Complication from Mayweather’s maneuver increases the mine’s Resistance by 2. Reed fails the Task, resulting in a setback: a spike impales his leg. Unable to continue, Captain Archer must take over to complete the Extended Task.

## Extended Tasks and Peril

If characters fail to achieve the required number of Breakthroughs or abandon the Extended Task, the Gamemaster may declare a **partial success**. This often results in additional Complications based on the number of Breakthroughs not achieved.
