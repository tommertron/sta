# Values

A character’s Values can help a character in difficult situations. They often provide an additional push to succeed, as the character’s convictions drive them to achieve more than they might have done otherwise. Whenever a character is attempting a Task for which one of their Values would be advantageous, they may spend one point of [[Determination]].
