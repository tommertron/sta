## Creating Major NPCs for Star Trek Adventures

Major NPCs play a critical role in the game, acting as compelling allies, adversaries, or key figures in your story. Here's a step-by-step guide to crafting them:

### Attributes and Disciplines
- **Attributes**: Begin with all attributes set at 7. Allocate an additional 14 points among them, but no single attribute may exceed 12.
- **Disciplines**: Start all disciplines at 1, then distribute an additional 10 points. No discipline can go above 5.

### Focuses and Values
- **Focuses**: Assign up to six Focuses that reflect the NPC's areas of expertise or specialization.
- **Values**: Define four Values that capture their core beliefs, motivations, and personality traits.

### Talents
- Choose **four Talents** or special rules to provide unique capabilities or advantages to the character.

### Stress and Weapon Damage
- **Stress**: Calculate the NPC's Stress by adding their Fitness and Security scores.
- **Weapon Damage**: Determine this by combining the weapon's base damage rating with the NPC's Security discipline.

### Special Abilities
- Major NPCs, like player characters, can avoid injuries by spending two Threat. Additionally, they can regain this ability during the same scene.

### Key Notes
- **Threat Usage**: Major NPCs can spend Threat to avoid injuries, a feature unavailable to Minor NPCs.
- **Customization**: Add narrative flavor to the NPC by integrating their traits and abilities into the story.

Crafting well-rounded Major NPCs enriches the gameplay experience, creating memorable encounters and deepening the story's impact.
