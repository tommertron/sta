# Ship Power

## Power and Ships

Starships generate significant power, but consume much maintaining key systems like propulsion, shields, life support, sensors, and computers. This section details how Power impacts your starship's capabilities.

**Power Reserve and Use:**

- Each scene, the ship regains its full Power capacity.
- Unused Power from the previous scene is lost.
- Power fuels specific actions and supports technologies.
- Basic operations like life support, communication, and maneuvering utilize Power automatically.

**Power Actions and Benefits:**

- **Going to warp, restoring shields:** These actions require specific Power expenditures.
- **Boosting Tasks:** Spending Power before a Task roll increases its Complication range (risk of issues).
- **Bonus Momentum:** Successful Tasks with spent Power award bonus Momentum.

**Power Loss:**

- Complications, damage, environmental effects, and certain weapons can deplete Power.
- Losing more Power than current reserves triggers a Complication on a random system.
- This reflects vital power loss impacting various ship functions.

**Power Capacity:**

- A ship's normal Power capacity equals its Engines system rating, with potential adjustments.
