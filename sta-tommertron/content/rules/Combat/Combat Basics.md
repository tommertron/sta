During a Turn in combat a character can attempt one [[Combat Tasks]] and several [[Combat Minor Actions]]

A character can perform ::one Minor Action for free::. Each additional Minor Action costs Momentum (Immediate) equal to the number of Minor Actions already performed that Turn. Each Minor Action can only be attempted once per Turn.
