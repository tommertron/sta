# Ship Actions - Internal Systems

## Basic Actions:

- **Assist:**
   - Nominate an ally and aid their Task.
- **Pass:**
   - Decline to attempt a Task.
- **Ready:**
   - Wait for a specific event before acting.
- **Override:**
   - Attempt any Task (increased difficulty).

## Ship Management

- **Power management:**
   - Daring/Control + Engineering, Difficulty 2
   - Gain 1 Power + 1 per Momentum spent (repeatable).
- **Regenerate shields**
   - Control + Engineering, Difficulty 1
   - Regain 2 Shields + 2 per Momentum (repeatable).
   - Increased difficulty at 0 Shields.
- **Damage control:**
   - Presence + Engineering, Variable Difficulty
   - Repair damaged systems (basically, send crews to do)
- **Transporters:**
   - Control + Engineering, Difficulty 2
   - Operate transporters (difficulty adjusted by situation).

The *Damage Control* Task listed on the Internal Systems and the Communications reference pages sends a repair team to handle the repairs. However, characters can use the *Change Position* Minor Action to move elsewhere in the ship, a character can head to the site of the damage, and attempt to perform the repairs personally. This will take a **Daring** or **Control + Engineering** **Task** with the Difficulty for repairs set by the damage suffered above.
