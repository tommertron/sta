# Area (Ship)

The attack affects a wider area, and can affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack, the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial target.
